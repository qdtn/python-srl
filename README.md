# python-srl
A PropBank style SRL system implemented in Python.

The system can work in two modes:

(1) Basic: Only hand-engineered linguistically-motivated feature templates are used

(2) Embeddings: The word embeddings of word-based basic features are used as extra features

Please cite the following paper if you use this SRL system:
